# This second project concerns the creation of a secure password generator.

#The goal is to create a password which will be easy to memorize, and hard to crack.

#Since this project is considerably delayed, here are the directions to a beta version:

#project-two.gopagoda.com (animation requires adjustments)

#http://project-two.gopagoda.com/generate-password.html (requires CSS)

#There is also the need for a button connecting both segments of the site.

#The project will undergo modifications to satisfy the necessities pointed out and you will be notified when they are available. Still, I undestand that, given the delay, it is better to present this version instead of holding it until the ideal one is ready.
